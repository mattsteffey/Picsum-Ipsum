## Overview
Users will be able to generate ipsum placeholder text based off of any word that they choose to input. From here, as long as users have gone through the proper outlets on the page to sign up for an account, they will be able to save that placeholder text for future use, and even delete and add certain words, as they see fit. Users may find a tool such as this useful for when they want to add placeholder text that contains words that are a little more tailored to the specific project.
### Datamuse API: www.datamuse.com/api
This API will be the only one used in this project. 
A description of the API as per their landing page:
> The Datamuse API is a word-finding query engine for developers. You can use it in your apps to find words that match a given set of constraints and that are likely in a given context. You can specify a wide variety of constraints on meaning,  spelling, sound, and vocabulary in your queries, in any combination.
### Google API: https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/
By utilizing the Google API I was able to add login functionality to my page. This links to the user's Google account and allows them to comment straight onto my home page. The goal is eventually get the functionality fleshed out so users can save and edit their favorite ipsums for later use.


## Stretch Goals
Set up a database call to make the ipsum logo text cycle through the ten most recently searched words, instead of a hard-coded set.
Utilize a database to allow users to save ipsums to a list of favorites, and give them the ability to edit words into or out of those lists.

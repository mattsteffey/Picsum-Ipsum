## Overview
Users will be able to generate ipsum placeholder text based off of any word that they choose to input. From here, as long as users have gone through the proper outlets on the page to sign up for an account, they will be able to save that placeholder text for future use, and even delete and add certain words, as they see fit.

### API: www.datamuse.com/api
This API will be the only one used in this project. 
A description of the API as per their landing page:
> The Datamuse API is a word-finding query engine for developers. You can use it in your apps to find words that match a given set of constraints and that are likely in a given context. You can specify a wide variety of constraints on meaning,  spelling, sound, and vocabulary in your queries, in any combination.
